LinkedBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue, and PriorityBlockingQueue are all implementations of the BlockingQueue interface
in Java, but they have different characteristics and use cases:

LinkedBlockingQueue:

Backed by linked nodes.
Optionally bounded (bounded if a capacity is specified upon creation).
Efficient for most use cases due to its unbounded capacity and dynamic resizing.
Ideal for scenarios where the number of elements can vary dynamically or is not known in advance.
Provides blocking operations (put and take) that wait until space becomes available (for put) or until an element
becomes available (for take).
ArrayBlockingQueue:

Backed by an array.
Always bounded (capacity must be specified upon creation).
Fixed capacity, which can lead to blocking when the queue is full or empty.
More memory-efficient compared to LinkedBlockingQueue because it does not need to manage linked nodes.
Suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is known in advance and does not change frequently, and memory usage
needs to be controlled.
PriorityBlockingQueue:

Backed by a priority heap.
Optionally bounded (bounded if a capacity is specified upon creation).
Orders elements based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator.
Elements are retrieved based on their priority rather than insertion order.
Useful for scenarios where elements need to be processed in priority order, such as task scheduling or event handling.
In summary:

Use LinkedBlockingQueue when you need a dynamically resizable, optionally bounded queue that is efficient for most use
cases and provides blocking operations.
Use ArrayBlockingQueue when you need a fixed-capacity, bounded queue with efficient memory usage and blocking operations.
Use PriorityBlockingQueue when you need a priority-ordered queue where elements are processed based on their priority.
