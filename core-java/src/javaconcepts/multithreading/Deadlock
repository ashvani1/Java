Deadlock in Java occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources that they
need to proceed. This situation typically arises when multiple threads acquire locks on different resources and then attempt
to acquire locks on additional resources held by other threads, resulting in a cyclic waiting scenario.

To resolve deadlock, you can follow these approaches:

Prevention:
Avoid acquiring multiple locks if possible.
Acquire locks in a fixed, predefined order to prevent cyclic dependencies.

Detection:
Use tools like thread dump analysis and monitoring tools to detect deadlocks in real-time.

Avoidance:
Use tryLock() method with a timeout to avoid waiting indefinitely for a lock.
Use Lock objects from the java.util.concurrent package, which offer more flexibility and control over locking.

Resolution:
If deadlock is detected, forcibly release one or more locks to break the deadlock. This approach should be used with caution
as it can lead to data corruption.
It's essential to design your multithreaded applications carefully to avoid deadlock situations, as they can be challenging
to diagnose and resolve. Proper synchronization, lock ordering, and deadlock prevention strategies are crucial for robust concurrent
programming in Java.
