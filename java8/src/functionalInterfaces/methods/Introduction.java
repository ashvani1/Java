    * A class can implements as many interfaces as we want
    * in our case we have Class CL and Interfaces as In1, In2 and In3 CL can implements all
    * if In1 has a default method and In2 extends In1 and override default methods then at runtime it will be In2 method
    * if Class CL override same method on class then on runtime it will be method from class
    *
    *
    * if In2 and In3 has default method m1() with same signature and CL implements In1 and In3 then CL must need to
      override m1() else code will not compile
